# Basic tetris

This is a simple Tetris app based on the excellent [freeCodeCamp tutorial by Ania Kubrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAUn1Lom6dw).

I learned a lot following this tutorial and then had fun customising and expanding on the functionality of Kubrow's basic tetris game.

My own additions include:

- hi-score display
- cleared lines display
- game restart function
- can now pause game without reset score
- additional tertrominos
- increasing speed levels based on the timings of the classic Nintendo Gameboy Tetris
- a more complex scoring system also based on the Gameboy version of Tetris
- some awesome chiptune music (which may get annoying after a while!)

By the way, the music isn't mine, it was composed by the brilliant Jonathon Dunn for the [ZX Spectrum version of 1988 video game RoboCop](https://youtu.be/9_JguaRYkpg).

I do intend to return my Tetris game in the future as there is an occassional and annoying display issue that I need to debug and fix (where some of the cells don't clear until an active tertromino passes through). I also want to make the UI responsive and get the controls working on mobile displays. But that's all for another day!
